## Project Overview
Our solution, driven by the motto "Empowering vision at every corner" is to develop an app using swift that enhances the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals.
The app will scan the environment, accept user commands via buttons or voice, and project a path to help users navigate to specific locations or items using audio and haptic feedback.
This intuitive tool will provide real-time, non-visual guidance, allowing users to confidently and safely navigate their homes.

## Repository Overview
- `NavSense/Feature Targets/ContentView.swift`: Contains the SwiftUI-based UI for displaying the AR view and depth points on the screen.
- `NavSense/Feature Targets/CustomARView.swift`: ARKit-based custom view that processes scene depth data and sends audio feedback based on detected object distance.
- `NavSense/Feature Targets/AudioManager.swift`: Manages all audio feedback based on proximity, converting distance ranges into specific audio cues.
- `NavSense/Feature Targets/CustomARViewRepresentable.swift`: SwiftUI wrapper for the CustomARView class, integrating AR functionalities with the SwiftUI view hierarchy.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements
- **Xcode**: Version 16.0 or later
- **Swift**: Version 6.0 or later
- **iOS**: Version 17.0 or later
- **Device**: iPhone or iPad with LiDAR sensor (iPhone 12 Pro and later, iPad Pro 2020 and later)

## Frameworks

The following frameworks are used in this project and are included in the iOS SDK. No additional installation is required:

- **ARKit**: For Augmented Reality features and LiDAR sensor integration
- **RealityKit**: For 3D rendering and scene understanding
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface
- **Combine**: For reactive programming patterns
- **AVFoundation**: For audio playback and management
- **CoreHaptics**: For haptic feedback generation

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiNat015/NavSense.git
```

2. **Open Xcode**

Ensure that you have Xcode installed on your Mac. You can install Xcode via the Mac App Store if you don't already have it.

Open Xcode, and you should see the following screen:

</p>

Click on '**Open Existing Repository**' and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Navigate to Project Settings**

Open **Project Settings** (highlighted in purple) and go to **Signing and Capabilities**. Select a **Team** using the dropdown select and paste `com.BumpLess.deco` in the **Bundle Identifier** field.

4. **Connect a Device**

Connect a supported iOS device (with a LiDAR sensor). Follow the setup prompts on both your computer and iOS device. To check the device's setup status, navigate to **Window > Devices and Simulators**. Your device name should appear in the left-hand navigation column.

5. **Build and Run the Project**

Once your device has been setup, make sure to select a valid target device from the toolbar. Press the Run button or use the shortcut `Cmd + R` to build and run the project.

6. **Grant Necessary Permissions**

Since BumpLess uses ARKit and provides audio feedback, the app will request permission to access the camera and microphone. Make sure to grant these permissions. You may also need to trust the developer to run the application. To do so, go to **Settings** on your iOS device, then **General > VPN and Device Management**, and trust the developer/team you selected earlier.

7. **Test the App**

You can now interact with the app through your iOS device.

## Using the Application
Once you've successfully installed and launched BumpLess on your iOS device, follow these steps to use the application:

1. **Hold the Device**: Hold your iOS device in portrait mode, with the camera facing forward as you would when taking a photo.

2. **Scan the Environment**: Slowly pan the device around your environment. The app will use the LiDAR sensor to scan and create a mesh of your surroundings.

3. **Listen for Audio Feedback**: As you move the device, you'll hear different audio cues:
   - An audio message indicating an object is immediately ahead (within 0.5 meters).
   - An audio message indicating an object is one step ahead (within 1.5 meters).
   - An audio message indicating an object is two steps ahead (within 2.0 meters).
   - An audio message indicating the path is clear if there is no object within 2.0 meters.

4. **Feel Haptic Feedback**: In addition to audio cues, you'll feel vibrations that correspond to the proximity of detected objects. Stronger vibrations indicate closer objects.

5. **Navigate Safely**: Use the audio and haptic feedback to guide your movements. Move slowly and adjust your direction based on the feedback to avoid obstacles.

6. **Explore Different Environments**: Practice using the app in various settings, starting with familiar spaces before moving to new environments.

Remember, BumpLess is designed to assist with navigation, but it should not replace other mobility aids or techniques you may use. Always prioritize your safety and use the app in conjunction with your existing navigation skills and tools.

## Known Bugs

While we continue to improve BumpLess, there are some known issues that users should be aware of:

1. **Navigation Feature Not Implemented**:
   - The Navigation feature shown in the UI is currently non-functional.
   - The interface elements for navigation do not perform any actions at this time.

2. **UI Overlap Issue**:
   - When both the settings and navigation UI are opened simultaneously, they may overlap, causing visual confusion.
   - This can potentially impact the user experience and readability of the interface.

3. **Audio Feedback Interruption**:
   - In some instances, the audio feedback may be cut off before completing.
   - This could potentially lead to incomplete or unclear directional cues.

We are actively working on resolving these issues and appreciate your patience. If you encounter any additional bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to report them through our issue tracker on GitHub.

## Results

Our testing showed that BumpLess accurately detects objects at various distances and provides real-time feedback to users. The app improves mobility by using audio cues that correlate to the userâ€™s distance from obstacles, helping them navigate through their environment safely and confidently.
